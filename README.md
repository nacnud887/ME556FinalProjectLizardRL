# ME556FinalProjectLizardRL
My final project for ME 556 is to use reinforcement learning in Isaac Lab. I set rewards and encouraged forward movement. Once I got a good gait in Isaac, I translated it over to hardware. You can find some of the code I used here!

Check out the Onboarding Guide word doccument for step by step instructions for setting up Isaac Lab!

This project is based on:
https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/pip_installation.html.

After following the directions for installation, there are specific files I changed. Here I will go through them in order, and explain where I saved them.

# 1) Lizard Robot Code
Under source > isaaclab_assets_isaaclab_assets > robots, I saved lizard.py
