# ME556FinalProjectLizardRL
My final project for ME 556 is to use reinforcement learning in Isaac Lab. I set rewards and encouraged forward movement. Once I got a good gait in Isaac, I translated it over to hardware. You can find some of the code I used here!

Check out the Onboarding Guide word doccument for step by step instructions for setting up Isaac Lab!
